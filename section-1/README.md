## What is PostgreSQL?

SQL is the language used to interact with databases. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## Challenges of Postgres

1. Writing efficient queries to retrieve information from the database.
2. Designing the schema, or structure, of the database.
3. Understanding when to use advanced features of PostgreSQL, such as indexes, views, and triggers.
4. Managing the database, including backups, replication, and scaling in a production environment.
