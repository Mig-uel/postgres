# Basic Query Tuning

## The Query Processing Pipeline

The query processing pipeline is the series of steps that a database system goes through to execute a query. Understanding this pipeline can help us identify performance bottlenecks and optimize our queries for better performance.

Here are the main steps in the query processing pipeline:

1. **Parsing**: The query is parsed to check for syntax errors and to create an internal representation of the query.

- **Lexical Analysis**: The query is broken down into tokens (keywords, identifiers, literals, etc.).
- **Syntax Analysis**: The tokens are analyzed to determine the structure of the query (e.g., SELECT statement, WHERE clause).
- **Semantic Analysis**: The query is checked for semantic errors (e.g., column not found, table does not exist).
- The parser build a query tree that represents the logical structure of the query which is a programmatic description of the query.

2. **Rewriting**: The query is rewritten to optimize it for execution. This step may involve simplifying the query, removing redundant operations, and transforming it into an equivalent form that is more efficient

- **Query Optimization**: The query optimizer generates multiple execution plans for the query and selects the one with the lowest cost. The cost is an estimate of the resources (e.g., CPU, memory, disk I/O) required to execute the plan.
- **Query Transformation**: The query may be transformed using various techniques such as predicate pushdown, join reordering, and subquery unnesting.
- The rewriter takes a look at the query tree and tries to simplify it as much as possible. What happens more frequently, it applies the idea of views. It replaces the query with a view that is already stored in the database.

3. **Planner**: The query planner generates an execution plan for the query. This plan specifies the steps that the database system will take to retrieve the requested data.

- **Query Planning**: The planner generates a plan that specifies the order in which operations will be performed (e.g., scan, filter, join, aggregate).
- **Cost Estimation**: The planner estimates the cost of each operation in the plan based on statistics about the data (e.g., number of rows, distribution of values).
- **Plan Generation**: The planner generates a plan that minimizes the total cost of executing the query.
- The planner takes the query tree and figures out what information you are trying to get and how to get it. It decides what indexes to use, what tables to scan, and what order to join the tables. Once plans are generated, it chooses the one with the lowest cost.

4. **Execution**: The execution engine executes the plan generated by the planner. This involves reading data from disk, applying filters and joins, and aggregating the results.

- **Data Access**: The engine reads data from disk or memory based on the plan (e.g., table scan, index lookup).
- **Query Execution**: The engine performs the operations specified in the plan (e.g., filter, join, aggregate).
- **Result Generation**: The engine produces the final result of the query based on the plan.
- Execution is the final step where the database system actually retrieves the data and processes it to produce the result.
