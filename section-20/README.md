# Implementing Database Design Patterns

## Back to Postgres

In the previous section, we discussed the different types of database design patterns. In this section, we will implement some of these patterns using Postgres.

**Moving Forward:**

- We will use Postgres to implement the database design patterns.
- We will create a new database using PGAdmin.
- Convert our ERD into a database schema.
- Insert data into the database tables.
- Write some queries.
- Realize that a few thing could have been designed better and make some changes.
