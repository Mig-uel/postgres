# How to Design a 'Follower' System

## Designing a 'Follower' System

A 'Follower' system is a system where a user can follow another user. This is a common feature in social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. In this system, a user can follow another user to get updates about their activities. The user who is being followed is called the 'followee', and the user who is following is called the 'follower'.

- A user can follow multiple users.
- A user can be followed by multiple users.
- A user cannot follow themselves.
- A user cannot follow the same user multiple times.

```sql
CREATE TABLE followers (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  follower_id INT NOT NULL,
  leader_id INT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE (follower_id, leader_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (follower_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (leader_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

In this design, we have a `followers` table that stores the relationship between followers and leaders. The `follower_id` column represents the user who is following, and the `leader_id` column represents the user who is being followed. We have a composite unique constraint on the `(follower_id, leader_id)` pair to ensure that a user cannot follow the same user multiple times. We also have foreign key constraints on the `follower_id` and `leader_id` columns to ensure that the users exist in the `users` table.
