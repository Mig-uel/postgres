# How to Build a 'Like' System

## Requirements of a 'Like' System

**Rules of 'Likes'**:

- A user can only like a post once.
- A user can unlike a post.
- Need to be able to see how many users liked a post.
- Need to be able to list all users who liked a post.
- Something besides a post can be liked (e.g., a comment).
- We might want to think about 'dislikes' or 'reactions' in the future.
