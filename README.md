# SQL and PostgreSQL Course

This repository contains my notes and code examples from the SQL and PostgreSQL course by Stephen Grider.

## Course Overview

In this course, I will learn the fundamentals of SQL and PostgreSQL, including database design, querying, and data manipulation. The course covers various topics such as creating tables, inserting data, retrieving data with SELECT statements, and performing advanced queries using JOINs and subqueries.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of SQL and PostgreSQL. Each module includes video lectures, hands-on exercises, and quizzes to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Repository Structure

- `notes/`: This directory contains my personal notes from each module, summarizing the key concepts and important syntax.
- `code/`: Here, I will find the code examples provided in the course. These examples can be used as a reference while practicing SQL and PostgreSQL.
